		<p>Here is a quote from pets4homes website:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/dog-breeds/german-shepherd/">
		German Shepherds are renowned for their intelligence alertness and loyalty. 
		However they are not the best choice for first-time owners because they need to be expertly and calmly handled with a firm yet gentle hand. 
		These dogs must know their place in the pack and that their owner is the alpha dog or they could start 
		displaying dominant behaviours which can lead to all sorts of problems which can make a GSD that much harder to handle.
